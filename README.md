## 1. Overview
Welcome to our project repository - Student Smart Printing Service application, which is a part of the course *Software Engineering* from HCMUT. We are group 14 from class CC01.

This project is about building a website for providing printing service as well as for management in which it directly connects students and printers. We mainly focus on two stakeholders of the application: Student and SPSO (Student Printing Service Officer) manager.

For students, they can upload the file and choose the printing properties as well as purchase for A4 printing paper. The printing log is recored for each user so that they can view it latter.

For SPSO manager, they can manage the system by configuring the printing properties allowance and scheduling the maintenance session. Also, they can query and view the printing history of students.
