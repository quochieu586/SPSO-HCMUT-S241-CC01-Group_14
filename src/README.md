# How to run the application ?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

After cloning the repo, to run the web, please make sure you have `npm` installation already.

## Running Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `serve -s build`

Runs the optimization version of app after `npm run build`.\
The page need to be re-built to see the changes you make, hence, it is used for final review but not for coding phrase.
